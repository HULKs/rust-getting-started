# Rust Introduction

This hands-on session is designed to introduce programmers to the Rust programming language, focusing on syntax and simple concepts.
Familiarity with other programming languages will be beneficial but is not mandatory.

## Preparation

1. Install `rustup` (<https://rustup.rs>)
2. Install the latest stable toolchain (should be the default)
3. Ensure that Rust is installed and accessible by running `cargo --version`
4. Install an editor/IDE of your choice (e.g. VSCode with 'Rust Analyzer Extension')

## Guidelines for a successful session

- The session may take long, around 7 hours
- We emphasize syntax and core introductory conteps, avoiding advanced features like generics. This allows participants to grasp the fundamentals and get started to explore Rust.
- Our goal is to incrementally build understanding by extending a single file (`main.rs`).
- Tutors should only explain concepts covered in the slides. Explanations and guidance should align with the presented content, ensuring a coherent learning experience.
- Tutors should engage with participants by walking around, answering questions, and providing guidance.

## Things to improve / TODOs

- figure to explain concept of `Vec<Vec<PixelColor>>`
- more additional and optional tasks
